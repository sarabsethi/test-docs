# Advanced

For advanced users familiar with embedded systems firmware development who would like to modify or perform advanced troubleshooting on Buggs, there are convenient interfaces for shell access and flashing custom images to the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 in the Bugg device. 

## Shell access 

You can gain shell access to the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 through a serial interface exposed through the connector at the bottom of the Bugg device. This is particularly useful for debugging the device without needing to open it up. 

To access the serial interface, connect USB power to pins X (5V+) and Y (5V-) and data to pins A (D+) and B (D-) of the M12 connector.
