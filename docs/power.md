# Power

Bugg devices should be powered via a stable 5-36V DC input through the [M12 connector](hardware.md#power-connector) at the bottom of the device. 

For testing purposes, the device can also be powered by USB. However, this is unstable and will result in a decrease in audio quality, so is not recommended for real deployments.

## DC power 

Bugg devices are delivered with male 8-way M12 unterminated cables (e.g., from [RS-Pro](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/sensor-actuator-cables/1547745)).

A 5-36V DC positive voltage should be supplied to pin <mark>X</mark> and ground to pin <mark>Y</mark>.
